# Introduction

This tutorial is an introduction to the main functionality of the [emulatorr](https://github.com/Tandethsquire/emulatorr) package, using a synthetic example of an epidemiological model. We start by briefly highlithing what hystory matching with emulation is and how it works.

Computer models, otherwise known as simulators, have been increasingly used by infectious disease modellers. Exceptional advancements in the speed and memory of computer processors have made it possible to run computations that were unimaginable only a few years ago. This computational power allows  epidemiologists to run rather complex computer models, such as stochastic individual-based models. In a field where large rigorously controlled experimental design are often impractical or unethical, simulations play a fundamental role, for example in designing and  evaluating population-level interventions. 

An infectious disease model is represented as a set of differential equations, which reflect the  fundamental dynamics of an infection disease, such as infectious people infecting susceptibles or infectious people recovering. Due to the complexity of the interactions, these models frequently contain large numbers of parameters. 

In order to use models for prediction and planning, it is fundamental to explore plausible values for their parameters, calibrating the models to empirical data. This poses a considerable problem, considering that it may take several minutes or even hours for the evaluation of a single scenario of a complex model. This problem is compounded for stochastic models, when hundreds or thousands of realisations are required for each scenario.  As a consequence, comprehensive analysis of the entire input space, requiring vast numbers of model evaluations, is often unfeasible. Bayes linear emulation, combined with history matching, allows us to overcome this issue.

## History Matching

History matching concerns the problem of identifying the set of inputs that would give rise to acceptable matches between the model outputs and the observed data. This part of the input space is referred to as non-implausible, while its complement is known as implausible. History matching proceeds as a series of iterations, or waves, where implausible inputs are identified and discarded. Each wave focuses the search for implausible space in the space that was characterized as non-implausible in all previous waves: thus the non-implausible space shrinks with each iteration. To decide whether an input $x$ is implausible we introduce the implausibility measure, which evaluates the distance between the observed data and the model’s output at $x$. If such measure is too high, the input is discarded in the next wave of the process. 

Note that history matching as just described still relies on the evaluation of the model at a large number of inputs, which is often unfeasible. Here is where emulators play a crucial role.

## Emulators   

A long established method for handling computationally expensive models is to first construct an emulator: a fast statistical approximation of the model that can be used as a surrogate. In other words, we can think of an emulator as a way of representing our beliefs about the behaviour of a complex model. 

The model is first run at a manageable number of paramter sets, to provide training data to build the emulator. The trained emulator will then provide an expected value of the model output at any input $x$, along with a corresponding uncertainty estimate reflecting our beliefs about the uncertainty in the approximation. In the [emulatorr](https://github.com/Tandethsquire/emulatorr) package we adopt a [Bayes Linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_linear_statistics) approach to build emulators. While a full Bayesian analysis requires specification of a full joint prior probability
distribution to reflect beliefs about uncertain quantities, in the Bayes linear approach expectations are taken as a primitive and only first and second order specifications are needed when defining the prior. Operationally, this implies that one just sets prior  mean vectors and covariance matrices for the uncertain quantities, without having to choose the shape of their joint distribution. Prior mean vectors and covariance matrices are then adjusted to the observed data.

Emulators have two advantages. First, they are computationally efficient - typically orders of magnitude faster than the computer models they approximate. Second, they allow for the uncertainty in their approximations to be taken into account. These two properties mean that emulators can be used to make inferences as a surrogate for the model itself. In particular, when going through the history matching process, it is possible to evaluate the implausibility measure at any given parameter set by comparing the observed data to the emulator’s output, rather than the model’s output. This speeds up the process and allows for a comprehensive exploration of the input space.


# Introduction to the model

The model in question is a stochastic  SEIRS model, with four parameters: rate of transmission between each infectious person and each susceptible person $\beta_M$; transition rate from exposed to infectious $\gamma_M$; recovery rate from infectious to recovered $\delta_M$; and a 'reinfection' rate from recovered to susceptible $\mu_M$.

``` {r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='SEIRS Diagram'}
knitr::include_graphics('SEIRSdiagram.png')
```

Expressed in terms of differential equations, the transitions are
\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\frac{\beta_M S I}{N} + \mu_M R \\
\frac{dE}{dt} &= -\gamma_M E + \frac{\beta_M I}{N} \\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= -\delta_M I + \gamma_M E \\
\frac{dR}{dt} &= -\mu_M R + \delta_M I
\end{align}
where $N$ represents the total population, $N=S+E+I+R$. For simplicity, we consider a closed population, so that $N$ is constant.

To generate runs from this model, we use [SimInf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SimInf/index.html), a package that provides a framework to conduct data-driven epidemiological modelling in realistic large scale disease spread simulations. This requires us to define the transitions, the compartments, and the initial population. If
we want multiple repetitions for each choice of parameters, we create a data.frame with identical rows, each of which has the same initial population. Here we will choose $50$ repetitions per choice of parameters and consider an initial population of $1000$ of who $50$ are infected. Note that if we were to start 
with one infectious individual, there would a be a significant probability that some runs of the model would not show an epidemic (since it could happen that the only infectious person recovers before infecting other people). Choosing a relatively high number of initial infectious people helps us circumvent any problems that would come from bimodality and keep the tutorial simple. Bimodality is dealt in the more advanced case studies. 

``` {r}
transitions <- c(
  "S -> beta*I*S/(S+I+E+R) -> E",
  "E -> gamma*E -> I",
  "I -> delta*I -> R",
  "R -> mu*R -> S"
)
compartments <- c("S","E","I","R")
nreps <- 50
u0 <- data.frame(
  S = rep(950, nreps),
  E = rep(0, nreps),
  I = rep(50, nreps),
  R = rep(0, nreps)
)
```
We select parameter values and parse the model using the function `mparse`, which takes transitions, compartments, initial data, parameter values and the time span to simulate a trajectory. We then run the model and plot the trajectories of interest.

``` {r}
params <- c(beta = 0.5, gamma = 0.5, delta = 0.1, mu = 0.1)
model <- mparse(transitions = transitions, compartments = compartments,
                u0 = u0, gdata = params, tspan = 1:60)
result = run(model)
plot(result, compartments = c("E","I","R"), col=c("#07AF3F", "#FAAE48","#48E2FA"))
```

In order to extract the relevant information from the data provided by the SimInf run, a helper function `getOutputs` has been included in this document. It takes a data.frame of parameter sets, and a list of times, and returns a data.frame of the results. We then create a data.frame `outputs` by binding the parameter values and the results obtained.
``` {r}
points <- expand.grid(list(beta = c(0.4, 0.6),
                           gamma = c(0.4, 0.6),
                           delta = c(0.05, 0.15),
                           mu = c(0.05, 0.15)
))
results <- getOutputs(points, seq(10,30,by=5))
outputs <- data.frame(cbind(points, results))
head(outputs)
```

Each row of `outputs` corresponds to a parameter set and contains information regarding the number of infectious individuals $I$ for that set. Each row of column $I10$ (resp. $I15, I20, I25, I30$) contains the mean value of $I$ at time $10$ (resp. $15, 20, 25, 30$) for the $50$ runs of the relative parameter set. Similarly, columns $EV10, EV15, EV20, EV25, EV30$ provide a measure of the 
<span class="abbr" title="Running a stochastic model at a given set of parameters produces different results each time. We refer to this form of uncertainty as Ensemble Variability"><abbr title="Running a stochastic model at a given set of parameters produces different results each time. We refer to this form of uncertainty as Ensemble Variability.">
ensemble variability</abbr></span>
for each parameter set, at each desidered time: this is defined here as the standard deviation of the $50$ runs, plus $3\%$ of the range of the runs. The trained emulators outputs will be estimates of the means, while the ensemble variability will be used to quantify the uncertainty of such estimates.

Before we actually tackle the emulation, we need a set of `wave0` data. For this, we define a set of ranges for the parameters, and generate parameter sets using a [Latin Hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling) design. We will run the model over $80$ parameter sets; $40$ of these will be used for training while the other $40$ will form the validation set for the emulators.

``` {r}
ranges <- list(
  beta = c(0.2, 0.8),
  gamma = c(0.2, 1),
  delta = c(0.1, 0.5),
  mu = c(0.1, 0.5)
)
pts <- 2*(maximinLHS(80, 4)-1/2)
r_centers <- map_dbl(ranges, ~(.[2]+.[1])/2)
r_scales <- map_dbl(ranges, ~(.[2]-.[1])/2)
pts <- data.frame(t(apply(pts, 1, function(x) x*r_scales + r_centers)))
head(pts)
```
Note that the first time we create `pts`, we get $80$ parameter sets where each parameter value is distributed on $[-1,1]$. This is not exactly what we need, since each parameter has a different range. We therefore define `r_centers` (resp. `r_scales`) which contains the midpoint (resp. the size) of the range of each parameter. Using these two pieces of information, we re-center and re-scale `pts`. 

Finally, we obtain the model runs for the parameter sets in `pts` through the `getOutputs` function. We bind the parameter sets in `pts` to the model runs and save everything in the data.frame `wave0`. 

```{r}
wave0 <- data.frame(cbind(pts,getOutputs(pts, seq(10,30,by=5)))) %>% 
  setNames(c(names(ranges), paste0("I",seq(10,30,by=5)),paste0('EV',seq(10,30,by=5))))
head(wave0)
```

# Constructing the emulators

An [emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator) is a way of representing our beliefs about the behaviour of an unknown function. In our case, where the model is stochastic, the unknown function is taken to be the mean of each of the model outputs over multiple runs. The definition of an emulator relies on a number of parameters that determine its characteristics (e.g. smoothness). Given a set of model runs and an estimate of the parameters, we use the emulator to get a probability distribution for the mean of a model's output at any input parameter set, without the need to run the model at the chosen input.

In this tutorial, we will construct an emulator for each of the model outputs separately. The general structure of a univariate emulator is as follows:
$$f(x) = g(x) \beta + u(x),$$
where $g(x)$ are the regression functions, $\beta$ the regression parameters, and $u(x)$ is the correlation structure. We split the correlation structure further into two pieces - for two parameter sets $x$ and $x^{\prime}$, the structure is:
$$u(x) = \sigma^2 (1-\delta) c(x,x^{\prime}) + \delta I_{\{x=x^\prime\}}.$$
Here $\sigma^2$ is the (prior) emulator variance and $c(x,x^{\prime})$ is a correlation function; the simplest such function is squared-exponential
$$c(x,x^{\prime}) = \exp\left(-\frac{\sum\limits_{i}(x_{i,A}-x_{i,A}^{\prime})^2}{\theta^2}\right).$$
The subscript $A$ indicates that the correlation function operates only on the active inputs for the emulator: that is, inputs that contribute to the regression surface. To ensure the correlation structure is well-defined, the 'nugget' term $\delta I_{\{x=x^{\prime}\}}$ is included: this operates on all the parameters in the input space and represents the proportion of the overall variance due to the ensemble variability. The $\theta$ hyperparamater is the correlation length for the emulator: the larger $\theta$ is, the smoother the local variations of the emulators will be. Note that one can also consider multiple correlation lengths, one for each input direction. 

To construct the emulators, a few steps are required:

- We first create a set of 'initial' emulators `ems0`, providing the estimates for the regression surface parameters and the basic correlation specifications (here we consider $\delta$ to be zero);

- The ensemble variability is compared to the variance of the 'initial' emulators, and their ratio is used as an estimate for $\delta$. Using this estimate the initial emulators are trained again;

- The emulators are trained one last time on the data using the Bayes Linear update formulae.

The function `emulator_from_data` does much of this work: given some observations, the regression parameters and active inputs are found for each output. Model selection is performed using [stepwise addition or deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression) (as appropriate), using the [AIC criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion) to find the minimal best fit. The standard error from this model is used as an estimate for $\sigma$.


``` {r}
samples <- sample(nrow(wave0), 40)
train0 <- wave0[samples,1:9]
valid0 <- wave0[!seq_along(wave0[,1])%in%samples,1:9]
output_names <- paste0("I",seq(10,30,by=5))
ems0 <- emulator_from_data(train0, output_names, ranges, quadratic = TRUE)
```
Here, after splitting `wave0` into training and validation sets, we passed the `emulator_from_data` function the training data, the name of the outputs we want to emulate, the list of parameter ranges and we specified quadratic regression (the default setting is linear regression). The output of `emulator_from_data` is a set of emulator objects (for details about the R6 class Emulator try `?Emulator`). Note that `emulator_from_data` will take any of the specifications as parameters, if the default behaviour does not provide an acceptable set of emulators.

Given this, we can find an estimate for the deltas by calculating the ratio of the ensemble variability to the overall emulator variance. We then create a new set of emulators, which we still call `ems0`  using the values of the deltas we estimated:
``` {r}
delts <- apply(wave0[10:ncol(wave0)], 2, mean)/map_dbl(ems0, ~.$u_sigma)
ems0 <- emulator_from_data(train0, output_names, ranges, quadratic = TRUE, deltas = delts)
ems0[[1]]
```



The print statement provides an overview of the emulator specifications and correlation structure, including 

- Basis Functions (here we have the four parameters beta, gamma, delta, mu and products of them, since we chose quadratic regression),

- Active variables,

- first and second order specifications for $\beta$ and $u(x)$. Note that  by default `emulator_from_data` assumes that $\text{Var}[\beta]=0$: the regression surface is known and coefficients are fixed. This explains why Beta Variance and Mixed Covariance (which shows the covariance of $\beta$ and $u(x)$) are both zero. One can set beta.var=TRUE in order to consider the beta parameters as random variables. 

We can plot the emulators to see how they represent the output space: the `emulator_plot` function does this for emulator expectation, variance, standard deviation, and implausibility (more on which later).
``` {r}
for (i in 1:length(ems0)) ems0[[i]]$output_name <- output_names[i]
names(ems0) <- output_names
emulator_plot(ems0)
emulator_plot(ems0, 'sd')
```
The emulator expectation plots show the structure of the regression surface, which is at most quadratic in its parameters, through a 2D slice of the input space. The emulator variance (or equivalently, standard deviation) is simply constant across the parameter space for each output. We now use the `adjust` method on our emulators to obtained the final Bayes Linear version of our `wave0` emulators:

```{r}
ems0_adjusted <- map(seq_along(ems0), ~ems0[[.]]$adjust(train0, output_names[[.]]))
```

Note that the `adjust` method works with the data in `train0` exactly as the function `emulator_from_data` did: it performs Bayes Linear adjustment, given the data. This function creates a new emulator object with the adjusted expectation and variance of beta as the primitive specifications, and supplies the data for the new emulator to compute the adjusted expectation and variance of $u(x)$, and the adjusted $Cov[\beta, u(x)]$. Due to the update formulae, the correlation structure isn't stationary anymore: the value of $\sigma^2$ is now $x$-dependent. 

```{r}
names(ems0_adjusted) <- output_names
emulator_plot(ems0_adjusted)
emulator_plot(ems0_adjusted, var = 'sd')
```

We can see that the adjusted emulators more reasonably show the structure of the model. The variance has been updated: the closer the evaluation point is to a training point, the lower the variance (as it 'knows' the value at this point). In fact, evaluating these emulators at the training points demonstrates this fact:
```{r}
em_evals <- ems0_adjusted$I10$get_exp(train0[,names(ranges)])
all(abs(em_evals - train0$I10) < 10^(-12))
all(ems0_adjusted$I10$get_cov(train0[,names(ranges)]) < 10^(-12))
```
Note the comparative speeds of evaluation, here. The initial $80$ parameter sets we generated from the model took around 45 seconds on a relatively powerful laptop; evaluating the emulator expectation over a $40\times40$ grid takes less than 5 seconds; evaluating the emulator variance over the same grid takes 30 seconds.

This is all fine, but we need to consider whether these emulators are actually performing as we would expect them to. For this, we need to consider emulator diagnostics.


# Emulator diagnostics

For a given set of emulators, we want to assess how accurately they reflect the model's outputs over the space. To do so, we can consider a number of diagnostic tests. First, however, we need to set up a framework for evaluating implausibility.

For a given output, and an observed value, the implausibility is defined as the difference between the predicted output and the actual observation, taking into account all sources of uncertainty; for input values $x$ the schematic form for the implausibility $I(x)$ is

$$I(x) = \frac{|f(x)-z|}{\sqrt{\sum \sigma^2}},$$

where $f(x)$ is the predicted output, $z$ the observation, and the $\sigma$ terms represent uncertainties. To use the implausibility, therefore, we need to define a set of observations at the output times. As our dataset is synthetic, we will take as our observations the model runs from a chosen parameter set, with a large number of repetitions; the means will provide the observations and the standard deviations at each parameter set will give the 'ensemble variability' representing the stochastic nature of the model.

```{r}
targets = list(
  I10 = list(val = 240, sigma = 25.27),
  I15 = list(val = 396, sigma = 40.99),
  I20 = list(val = 453, sigma = 46.48),
  I25 = list(val = 428, sigma = 43.98),
  I30 = list(val = 392, sigma = 40.30)
)
```

The uncertainties that go into the denominator of the emulator implausibility are the ensemble variability defined, and the emulator variance at the given parameter set. Note that if our data were not synthetic, we would also include the observation uncertainty, to represent the finite accuracy with which real data is observed and the model discrepancy, accounting for the fact that no model perfectly represents reality.

An important thing to consider is the choice of cut-off for the implausibility measure. The implausibility is a metric for evaluating how far out from being a good fit any input parameter set is: there is no hard-and-fast rule for deciding at what point a parameter set is too implausible. Indeed, there are two things to consider when we have multiple univariate emulators.

First of all: what cut-off should we impose? A rough rule of thumb loosely follows Pukelsheim's $3\sigma$ rule, which states that any unimodal distribution can be treated normally, in the sense that a $5\%$ confidence interval corresponds to $3\sigma$ around the mean. This is only the case for a single such distribution; for multiple univariate emulators it is slightly more involved. However a rough starting cut-off $m$, for confidence interval $1-\alpha$ and $N$ emulators, would be
$$m = \Phi^{-1}\left(\frac{1+(1-\alpha^{1/N})}{2}\right)$$
where $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse of the normal distribution CDF.

Second: given multiple emulators, how do we measure overall implausibility? We want a single measure for the implausibility at a given parameter set, but for each emulator we obtain an individual value for $I$. The simplest way to combine them is to consider maximum implausibility at each parameter set:
$$I_M(x) = \max_{i=1,\dots,N}I_{i}(x),$$
where $I_i(x)$ is the implausibility at $x$ coming from the $i$th emulator. For large collections of emulators, it may be useful to instead consider the second-, or third-maximum implausibility. Where some outputs are deemed more important than others (for instance, putting greater weight on emulation of the peak of an epidemic), we may instead take a weighted average across the implausibity measures.
The default behaviour of the diagnostics and plots we will see here is to take a cut-off of $3$ (following Pukelsheim's $3\sigma$ rule), and take maximum implausibility across the outputs. For instance, to find the emulator implausibility for the first output we use the `emulator_plot` function specifying 'imp' for implausibility and passing it the target for the first output:

```{r}
emulator_plot(ems0_adjusted[[1]], 'imp', targets = targets[[1]])
```

This is a 2D slice through the input space: chosen a pair $(\bar\beta,\bar\gamma)$, the plot shows the implausibility of the input parameter set $(\bar\beta, \bar\gamma, \delta_M, \mu_M)$, where $\delta_M$ denotes the mid-range value of the delta parameter and similarly for $\mu_M$. Parameter sets with a high implausibility (orange region) are highly unlikely to give a good fit and will be discarded when forming the parameters sets for the next wave.

The first three diagnostics are relatively straightforward, and can be presented together. For a given validation set, we can consider the following:

- Within uncertainties, does the emulator output accurately represent the equivalent model output?

- What are the standard errors of the emulator outputs in light of the model outputs?

- Does the emulator adequately classify parameter sets as implausible or non-implausible?

These are encapsulated in the `validation_diagnostics` function.

``` {r}
which_invalid <- validation_diagnostics(ems0_adjusted, valid0, output_names, targets = targets)
```

The first column of plots gives an indication of the emulator outputs against the model outputs: the emulator outputs are plotted against the model outputs with a $3\sigma$ confidence interval overlaid. An 'ideal' emulator would exactly reproduce the model results: this behaviour is represented by the green line $f(x)=E[f(x)]$. Any parameter set whose emulated prediction lies more than $3\sigma$ away from the simulated output is highlighted in red. 

The second column gives the standard errors: generally we would like the standard errors to be within $-2$ and $2$. 

Finally, the third column compares the emulator implausibility at the parameter sets to the equivalent model implausibility. There are three cases to consider:

- The emulator and model both classify a set as implausible/non-implausible: this is fine. Both are giving the same classification for the set of points.

- The emulator classifies a set as non-implausible, while the model rules it out: this is also fine. The emulator should not be expected to shrink the parameter space as much as the model does, at least not on a single wave. Points classified in this way will survive this wave, but may be removed on subsequent waves as the emulators grow more accurate on a reduced parameter space.

- The emulator rules out a set, but the model does not: these are the problem sets, suggesting that the emulator is ruling out parts of the parameter space that it should not be ruling out.


The function `validation_diagnostic`, along with producing the plots, also returns a data.frame consisting of those parameters sets which failed one or more diagnostic tests. 

``` {r}
which_invalid
``` 

It is often worth considering these points, particularly if they lie close to the boundary of the space: having a few parameter sets which fail diagnostics is not the end of the world, but we should at least consider whether the emulator is failing in parts of the space we would want it to be performing well on.

A helper for visualising these problem parameter sets is provided in the function `validation_pairs`: this gives pairs plots of the validation points for each parameter pair, colouring the points by their diagnostic success (bottom left) and predicted implausibility (top right). The diagnostics part gives the maximum standard error at each point: the standard error is $$\frac{|\text{emulator value}-\text{model value}|}{\sqrt{\text{emulator variance}}}$$ for each output and we maximise over the outputs. 

``` {r}
vp <- validation_pairs(ems0_adjusted, valid0, targets)
```

We can see that the points that are struggling with diagnostics are indeed on the boundaries of the space, particularly on the boundary of the $(\delta,\mu)$ space. Examination of the upper half of this plot shows that a large proportion of the points are due to be ruled out as non-implausible, so they lie in parts of the parameter space that will have no impact on the overall history matching process.

Where multiple outputs are concerned, emulator functions make a call to `nth_implausible` with default $n=1$. This can be modified in any function call that uses it. For instance, the above diagnostic plot will consider minimum implausibility in its upper plots if we set $n$ to be the number of emulators:

``` {r}
vp2 <- validation_pairs(ems0_adjusted, valid0, targets, n=length(ems0))
```

One way we can get a feel for what cut-off value is reasonable is via the `space_removed` function, which for a given set of emulators will determine how much of the space will be removed by a particular implausibility cut-off.  By default, `space_removed`  considers varying the structural discrepancy, and does so in steps of $10\%$ around $100\%$. Being our data synthetic, the `space_removed` function will vary the ensemble variability, which we can consider as a form of internal discrepancy.

``` {r}
sp1 <- space_removed(ems0_adjusted, valid0, targets)
```

A cut-off of $3$ here, using maximum implausibility, would be sufficient to remove around $75\%$ of the current parameter space. This is a reasonable level of removal for a first wave: however, if the expected amount of removal was much lower we could consider whether it is sensible to reduce the cut-off (a companion plot that shows how many diagnostic failures would result from a particular cutoff value is in the pipeline).

We can also consider what would happen if we were to modify the emulator variances or the correlation lengths. To do this we set `modified ='var'` or `modified='corr'`. This evaluates over a fairly large set of parameter sets and has to retrain multiple sets of emulators, so does take a while to run. For the purposes of speed, here, we set `n_points` to $5$: this creates a set of $5^d$ points to evaluate over, where $d$ is the dimension of the input space. As before, the default behaviour considers steps of $10\%$ around $100\%$. Here we set the `u_mod` argument in the function call to choose different steps for the variance.

``` {r}
sp2 <- space_removed(ems0_adjusted, valid0, targets, u_mod = c(0.75, 1, 1.25), modified = 'var', n_points = 5)
sp3 <- space_removed(ems0_adjusted, valid0, targets, modified = 'corr', n_points = 5)
```

We can see that changing the correlation lengths has a minimal impact on the resultant space reduction: this should not be surprising in this case, as the linear part of the emulators (i.e. the $g(x)\beta$ term) is sufficient to capture much of the dynamics of the points:

```{r}
map_dbl(ems0, ~summary(.$model)$adj.r.squared)
```

The adjusted $R^2$ of the linear models are all high, so the correlation structure is having to do very little 'work' for the emulators to match the data. If we instead had a model where the linear part cannot accurately represent the output surface, the choice of correlation lengths would be a much more important choice, and the final plot above would be a much stronger indicator of suitability.

In any event, the diagnostics here give an indication of the suitability of the emulators in emulating the outputs at this wave. If there are particular outputs for which the emulators do not give a good fit, then we can modify the specifications for that emulator directly (for example, modifying the correlation length, the variance, or the regression surface) and re-train; if the emulator simply cannot provide a good fit to the output, we can choose not to emulate this output for the wave in question.


# Point Generation

Having generated emulators based on the first wave of data, evaluated their suitability, and considered a means by which to rule out parameter sets, we can now produce a new set of parameter sets to pass to the model. The function `generate_new_runs` is designed for this purpose; its default behaviour is as follows.

- If no prior parameter sets are provided, a set  is generated using a [Latin Hypercube Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling), rejecting implausible points;
- Using these as seeding points, more parameter sets are generated using [importance sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Importance_sampling) to attempt to fully cover the non-implausible region;
- Finally, pairs of parameter sets are selected at random and more sets are sampled from lines connecting them, with particular importance given to those that are close to the non-implausible boundary.

All of these steps can be overridden or modified, but the default behaviour allows for a good rudimentary search of the non-implausible space.

```{r}
new_points <- generate_new_runs(ems0_adjusted, ranges, n_points = 120, z = targets)
plot(new_points, pch = 16, cex = 0.5)
```

We can start to see the structure of the non-implausible region, here. The `wave_points` function provides a better indication of the difference between the two sets of wave data.

``` {r}
wave_points(list(wave0, new_points), in_names = names(ranges))
```

Here `wave0` points are in yellow and `new_points` are in purple. The plots in the main diagonal show the distribution of points in `wave0` and that of `new_points`. 

Now we can put `new_points` into the model and obtain the outputs:

```{r}
next_wave <- getOutputs(new_points, seq(10,30,by=5))
```

Binding together `new_points` and `next_wave` we obtain `wave1`, the full data for the next wave. We can see how much better the `wave1` parameter sets perform compared to the original `wave0` parameter sets using `simulator_plot`.

``` {r}
wave1 <- data.frame(cbind(new_points,next_wave)) %>% setNames(c(names(ranges), paste0("I",seq(10,30,by=5)), paste0("EV",seq(10,30,by=5))))
all_points <- list(wave0[1:9], wave1[1:9])
simulator_plot(all_points, targets)
```

We can see that, compared to the space-filling random parameter sets used to train the first emulators, the new parameter sets are in much closer agreement with the data we wish to match to. Subsequent waves, trained on these new parameter sets, will be more confident in the new non-implausible region and will therefore refine the region in light of the greater certainty.


# Further waves

We follow the same procedure for subsequent waves, with a couple of caveats. 

First of all we train a new set of emulators, in the same way we did for `ems0`:

``` {r}
sampling <- sample(nrow(wave1), 40)
train1 <- wave1[sampling,1:9]
valid1 <- wave1[!seq_along(wave1[,1])%in%sampling,1:9]
new_ranges <- map(names(ranges), ~c(min(wave1[,.]), max(wave1[,.]))) %>% setNames(names(ranges))
ems1 <- emulator_from_data(train1, output_names, new_ranges, quadratic = T)
deltas <- apply(wave1[,10:14], 2, mean)/map_dbl(ems1, ~.$u_sigma)
ems1 <- emulator_from_data(train1, output_names, new_ranges, deltas = deltas, quadratic = TRUE)
for (i in 1:length(ems1)) ems1[[i]]$output_name <- output_names[i]
ems1_adjusted <- map(seq_along(ems1), ~ems1[[.]]$adjust(train1, output_names[[.]]))
names(ems1_adjusted) <- output_names
```

We can apply diagnostics to this as before, using `valid1` as the validation set. Assuming the diagnostics are acceptable, we  then proceed to consider implausibility - however, we need the implausibility over the whole input space, and the new emulators have only been trained on a subset thereof. We must therefore consider implausibility across all waves, rather than just the wave under consideration at the time.

``` {r}
all_waves <- c(ems0_adjusted, ems1_adjusted)
all_targets <- c(targets, targets)
emulator_plot(all_waves, var = 'maximp', targets = all_targets)
```

This may seem an unwieldy way to approach this (and it is, at present); however, it is important to remember that the number of emulators at each wave may not be the same; for example, if we have had to remove an output at wave 1, then the targets would be accordingly changed. In this illustration case, we did not have to worry about doing so since we have assumed that all targets can be emulated.

The remainder of the analysis proceeds much as in the first wave. In generating new parameter sets, we would of course provide `all_waves` to the point generation function.

Finally, a basic wave generation function is provided to avoid stepping through the sets presented here: the function `full_wave` will take training data, validation data, and a desired number of parameter sets and generate the next set of parameter sets (for details, as always, try `?full_wave`).

``` {r}
test_full_wave <- full_wave(train0, valid0, ranges, output_names, targets, 120, sample_method = 'importance')
wave_points(list(new_points, test_full_wave$next_sample), names(ranges))
```
This returns four objects: the trained emulators, the base emulators used for calibration, the new parameter ranges, and the new sample parameter sets to pass to the model. We can see that the performance is comparable to the step-through of the functions; however, we have less control over expert judgement of suitability of emulators, cut-off values, and other considerations.

# TJ material
```{r, child = "_setup.Rmd", include = F, purl = F, cache = F}
```

Basically a standard Bookdown template with a few tweaks. New chapters need to be in separate '.Rmd' files, where each file starts with a chapter heading as seen [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/usage.html). In order to use the task and solution blocks in \LaTeX, you must input the order of the files into the `_bookdown.yml` file, and the first file must be called `index.Rmd` e.g.

```
rmd_files:
    html: ['index.Rmd', 'ch1.Rmd']
    latex: ['index.Rmd', 'ch1.Rmd', 'ch_appendix.Rmd']
output_dir: "docs"
```

The `latex:` path above ***must*** have `'ch_appendix.Rmd'` as its last entry. This ensures that the appendix is properly formatted for the solutions to the problems.

You must have the following lines at the start of your `index.Rmd` file:

````
```{r, child = "_setup.Rmd", include = F, purl = F, cache = F}`r ''`
```
````

There are a couple of useful special blocks. A `task` block, and a `solution` block. These can be used as e.g.

````
```{task}`r ''`
Here is a task written in **markdown**.
```
````

which renders as:

```{task}
Here is a task written in **markdown**.
```

You can include chunks within the `task` chunk, but you need to use double backticks *within* the chunk, and leave carriage returns around the internal chunk e.g.

````

```{task}`r ''`

``{r}
x <- 2 + 2
x
``

```

````

which renders as:

```{task}

``{r}
x <- 2 + 2
x
``

```

Be careful to have suitable carriage returns around e.g. `enumerate` or `itemize` environments inside the chunk also. For example:

````

```{task}`r ''`
Here is a list:
1. item 1
2. item 2
```

```` 

will not render nicely. But

````

```{task}`r ''`
Here is a list:

1. item 1
2. item 2

```

```` 

will:

```{task}
Here is a list:

1. item 1
2. item 2

```

The `solution` chunk works in the same way, and the numbers will follow the previous `task` chunk (so you can set tasks without solutions) e.g.

````

```{task}`r ''`
Add 2 and 2 together
```

```{solution}`r ''`

``{r}
2 + 2
``

```

````

gives:

```{task}
Add 2 and 2 together
```

```{solution}

``{r}
2 + 2
``

```

## Additional extensions

### Different task and solution titles

Task and solution boxes can also be given different names using the `title` option e.g.

````

```{task, title = "Question"}`r ''`
What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?
```

```{solution, title = "Answer"}`r ''`
Why 42 of course!
```

````

gives:

```{task, title = "Question"}
What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?
```

```{solution, title = "Answer"}
Why 42 of course!
```

### Turning tasks and solutions on and off

Sometimes you might want to hide task and/or solution boxes. This can be done with the `renderTask` and `renderSol` chunk options, which can be set globally or locally. For example:

````

```{task, title = "Question"}`r ''`
Can I set a task and not show the answer?
```

```{solution, title = "Answer", renderSol = FALSE}`r ''`
Indeed, though you won't see this answer unless `renderSol = TRUE`...
```

````

typesets as:

```{task, title = "Question"}
Can I set a task and not show the answer?
```

```{solution, title = "Answer", renderSol = FALSE}
Indeed, though you won't see this answer unless `renderSol = TRUE`...
```

### Tabbed boxed environments

Originally developed to put base R and `tidyverse` solutions side-by-side, using a `multCode = T` option to the solution box. Here the two tabs are separated by four consecutive hashes: `####`, and the `titles` option gives the tab titles (these can be set globally if preferred) e.g.

```{r, include = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

````

```{task}`r ''`
Filter the `iris` data by `Species == "setosa"` and find the mean `Petal.Length`.
```

```{solution, multCode = T, titles = c("Base R", "tidyverse")}`r ''`

``{r}
## base R solution
mean(iris$Petal.Length[
    iris$Species == "setosa"])
``

####

``{r}
## tidyverse solution
iris %>% 
    filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
    select(Petal.Length) %>%
    summarise(mean = mean(Petal.Length))
``
    
```

````

will typeset to:

```{task}
Filter the `iris` data by `Species == "setosa"` and find the mean `Petal.Length`.
```

```{solution, multCode = T, titles = c("Base R", "tidyverse")}

``{r}
## base R solution
mean(iris$Petal.Length[
    iris$Species == "setosa"])
``

####

``{r}
## tidyverse solution
iris %>% 
    filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
    select(Petal.Length) %>%
    summarise(mean = mean(Petal.Length))
``
    
```

Note that there is also a `multCode` chunk that does not link to task and solution boxes e.g.

````

```{multCode}`r ''`

Two options: 

* Option 1

####

Two options:
    
* Option 2

```

````

will typeset to:

```{multCode}

Two options: 

* Option 1

####

Two options:
    
* Option 2

```

The `titles` option can be set as before.
